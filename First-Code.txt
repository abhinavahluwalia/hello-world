My first code on Github isnt really exciting.
I guess because its just a tool and while it is a useful one.
It isnt enough to get me excited.

So I just tested the branch feature and well..
Maybe its a little bit more exciting.
But as you know, it isn't crazy.

Now im really trying something crazy.
Making two branches and doing simultaneuos edits.

Simultaneous editing in master as well.
Well well...
