My first code on Github isnt really exciting.
I guess because its just a tool and while it is a useful one.
It isnt enough to get me excited.

So I just tested the branch feature and well..
Maybe its a little bit more exciting.
But as you know, it isn't crazy.






Simultaneous editing in master as well.
Well well...
